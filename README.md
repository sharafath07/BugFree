## 📜 Project Description

BugFree is a fun little web-based tool that generates **random funny human characteristics** on button click. It's pointless, whimsical, and the perfect dose of digital nonsense — ideal for when you just need a good laugh (or a weirdly specific personality roast).

---

## 💡 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

We realized the world lacked a one-click solution to discover your completely random and probably inaccurate trait. So we built one. BugFree is like your quirky internet mirror — reflecting what no one asked to see.
